# Timer

## Description
This web app is a simple timer/clock. It is a personal project to track my time when creating projects. There is also a clock page, to be kept on when im not working. The clock functionality is not perfect (time is not displayed correctly for firdt ten seconds), but this is a quick tool for personal use and is not subject to be fixed.

## How to use
If you also want to run this app, clone this repository, install all the dependencies (npm install), then either run it for development (npm start) or build for deployment (npm run build).

## Tools
- React
